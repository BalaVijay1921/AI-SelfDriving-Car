# AI-SelfDriving-Car
 An AI-powered self-driving car processes input images and videos to understand the road. Using basic perception, it identifies lanes, detects obstacles, and predicts the vehicle’s path. A control module then manages steering and speed, enabling smooth autonomous driving in simulation.
